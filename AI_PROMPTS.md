## Prompt 1
**Commit:** `55ba4c6afa040155030fe424756a227647da89fc`

```text
I want to to implement the following:
- Build the fastest, correct, and well-engineered 48-bit timestamp generator
- Encode generated timestamp in Base64URL format, so we will get 8 characters timestamp containing 48-bit timestamp
- Focus on performance and maintainability

Here's more information on the 48-bit timestamps that I found on the Internet. In your implementation, please refer to the specification below: ``It's a 48 bit number with:
12 bits for the year (starting at 0)
4 bits for the month (this year)
5 bits for the day (this month)
5 bits for the hour (this day)
6 bits for the minute (this hour)
6 bits for the second (this minute)
10 bits for the millisecond (this second)

It's written in UTC time.

So for instance if you wanted to write 2019-06-16 19:11:22.333 it would be

          2019  -06   -16    19    :11    :22       .333
0b011111100011 0110 10000 10011 001011 010110 0101001101

0b01111110 00110110 10000100 11001011 01011001 01001101

aka

0x7E 36 84 CB 59 4D``

The solution **must** have a single export method `generateTimestamp48()`
```

```text
Let's update the implementation to always perform validation, regardless of the environment
```

### Prompt 3
Commit: 482a2cd211ff35ba1c281690a68327cc1fd9bd37
```text
write unit tests for `generateTimestamp48`, including performance test for running 1 million iterations of `generateTimestamp48` function. Make sure to import all necessary modules from `node:test`.
```

### Prompt 4
Commit: a0820927fdd7ef3dd8ff0e7ac6b3420c24104aff
```text
Currently, one unit test is failing (`should throw error for invalid date`). Make sure the implementation includes assertion for invalid dates and throws exception in case invalid input was provided
```

### Prompt 5
Commit: 0b277faa4117778e3de6ac769cec65e97daecce1
```text
can you add `d.ts` file for `timestamp.js`?
```
